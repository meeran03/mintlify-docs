## The Tabbed Interface

When creating or editing an assistant, you'll see three main tabs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="LLM (Language Model)">

  ### What is the LLM?
  The LLM (Large Language Model) is the "brain" of your assistant. It understands what callers say and generates smart, helpful responses.

  ### Key Settings
  <Checklist>
  - **Provider:** Choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, xAI, Groq, or a custom endpoint.
  - **API Key:** Paste your provider's API key (get it from their dashboard).
  - **Model:** Pick the model (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash).
  - **Base URL:** (For some providers) Set a custom API endpoint.
  - **Temperature:** Controls creativity. Lower = more predictable, higher = more creative. <br/> <Callout type="tip">0.7 is a good starting point!</Callout>
  - **Max Tokens:** Limits response length. <br/> <Callout type="tip">1000 tokens ≈ 250 words. Good for phone calls.</Callout>
  - **System Prompt:** Set your AI's personality and instructions (e.g., "You are a friendly assistant...").
  - **Greeting Message:** The first thing callers hear.
  - **Fallback Providers:** Add up to 3 backup LLMs for reliability.
  </Checklist>

  <Accordion title="How do Fallbacks Work?">
  If your main LLM provider fails (e.g., rate limit, downtime), the system automatically tries your backup providers in order. This keeps your assistant reliable—even if one provider has issues.
  </Accordion>

  </Tab>
  <Tab label="TTS (Text-to-Speech)">

  ### What is TTS?
  TTS turns the AI's text responses into a natural-sounding voice. Choose from multiple providers to match your quality, speed, and language needs.

  ### What is STT?
  STT converts what the caller says into text for the AI to understand.

  - **Model:** Nova-3, Nova-2, Enhanced, etc. (Deepgram)

  - For non-English calls, set the correct language code
  - Adjust silence settings if the AI cuts callers off too soon or waits too long
  </Accordion>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
