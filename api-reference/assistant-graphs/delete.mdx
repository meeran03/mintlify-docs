## Side Effects

When you delete a graph:

<Warning>
**The following data is permanently deleted:**
- All nodes in the graph
- All edges in the graph
- All conversation session records
- All intent detection logs for those sessions
</Warning>

<Note>
**The following data is NOT deleted:**
- The underlying assistants (they remain available for other graphs or direct use)
- Phone numbers (they are unassigned from the graph but not deleted)
- Call records (they remain for billing and analytics purposes)
</Note>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Active Calls">
    Before deleting a graph, ensure there are no active calls using it. Deleting a graph during active calls may cause unexpected behavior.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Unassign Phone Numbers First">
    Consider explicitly unassigning phone numbers before deletion to ensure they're properly reconfigured.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export Data If Needed">
    If you need conversation session data for analytics, export it before deletion using the sessions endpoint.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Consider Deactivation">
    If you may need the graph later, consider setting `is_active: false` instead of deleting.
  </Step>
</Steps>
