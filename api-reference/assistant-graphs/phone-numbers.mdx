title: 'Phone Number Assignment'
description: 'Assign and manage phone numbers for assistant graphs'
---

Phone numbers can be assigned to assistant graphs to enable multi-assistant orchestration for inbound calls. When a call comes in on an assigned phone number, it's routed through the graph's entry node.

<ParamField path="graph_id" type="integer" required>

## Assign Phone Number to Graph

<api method="POST" endpoint="/api/v1/assistant-graphs/{graph_id}/phone-numbers/{phone_number_id}/assign" />

Assign a phone number to an assistant graph. This enables the graph's multi-assistant orchestration for calls to this number.

<ParamField path="graph_id" type="integer" required>
  The unique identifier of the graph.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="phone_number_id" type="integer" required>
  The unique identifier of the phone number to assign.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Whether the assignment was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Confirmation message.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  Assignment details.
  <Expandable title="Data properties">
    <ResponseField name="graph_id" type="integer">The graph ID</ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="phone_number_id" type="integer">The phone number ID</ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="graph_name" type="string">Name of the graph</ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<RequestExample>
```bash Assign Phone Number
curl -X POST https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/assistant-graphs/1/phone-numbers/5/assign \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/assistant-graphs/1/phone-numbers/5/assign",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

result = response.json()
if result['success']:
    print(f"Phone number assigned to {result['data']['graph_name']}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/assistant-graphs/1/phone-numbers/5/assign',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  }
);

const result = await response.json();
if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Phone number assigned to ${result.data.graph_name}`);
}
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Assign Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Phone number successfully assigned to graph 'Customer Service Router'",
  "data": {
    "graph_id": 1,
    "phone_number_id": 5,
    "graph_name": "Customer Service Router"
  }
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<Warning>
Assigning a phone number to a graph **overrides** any previous assistant assignment. The phone number can only be assigned to either an individual assistant OR a graph, not both.
</Warning>

## Unassign Phone Number from Graph

<api method="POST" endpoint="/api/v1/assistant-graphs/{graph_id}/phone-numbers/{phone_number_id}/unassign" />

Remove a phone number from an assistant graph. The phone number remains in your organization but is no longer routed through the graph.

<ParamField path="graph_id" type="integer" required>
  The unique identifier of the graph.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="phone_number_id" type="integer" required>
  The unique identifier of the phone number to unassign.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Whether the unassignment was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Confirmation message.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  Unassignment details.
</ResponseField>

result = response.json()
if result['success']:
    print("Phone number unassigned successfully")
```

</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Unassign Response
{

## Assignment Behavior

### When Assigning to a Graph

1. **Previous Assignment Cleared**: If the phone number was assigned to an individual assistant, that assignment is removed
2. **Graph Entry Node**: Incoming calls are routed to the graph's entry node
3. **Orchestration Enabled**: Multi-assistant routing becomes active for this number

### When Unassigning from a Graph

1. **Routing Disabled**: Calls to this number will no longer be handled by the graph
2. **Re-assignment Required**: The phone number must be assigned to either another graph or an individual assistant to handle calls
3. **No Automatic Fallback**: Unassigned numbers don't automatically fall back to any default handler

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Phone number assignment failed (e.g., already assigned elsewhere) |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| 404 | Graph or phone number not found in your organization |
| 500 | Server error |

<Tip>
To see all phone numbers in your organization (not just those assigned to a graph), use the [Organization Phone Numbers](/api-reference/organization/list-phonenumbers) endpoint.
