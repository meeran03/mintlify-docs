### Response

The response is a JSON object containing an array of cloned voice objects.

}
```

### Response Fields

- `id` (integer): Unique identifier for the cloned voice
- `name` (string): Display name of the cloned voice
- `provider` (string): TTS provider that hosts this voice
- `provider_voice_id` (string): Provider-specific voice identifier
- `language` (string): Language code of the voice (e.g., "en", "es")
- `gender` (string): Detected or specified gender ("male", "female", null)
- `status` (string): Current status of the cloned voice
- `quality_score` (float): Quality score from 0.0 to 1.0 (if available)
- `created_at` (string): ISO 8601 timestamp of voice creation
- `last_used_at` (string): ISO 8601 timestamp of last synthesis (null if never used)
- `synthesis_count` (integer): Total number of times this voice has been used

### Voice Status Values

- `processing`: Voice cloning is still in progress
- `ready`: Voice is successfully cloned and ready for use
- `failed`: Voice cloning failed during processing
- `archived`: Voice has been archived and is no longer active

### Quality Scores

Quality scores are provider-dependent and may not be available for all voices:

- **0.9 - 1.0**: Excellent quality, production-ready
- **0.8 - 0.9**: Good quality, suitable for most use cases
- **0.7 - 0.8**: Fair quality, may need improvement
- **< 0.7**: Poor quality, consider re-training with better samples

### Usage Analytics

The response includes usage analytics for each voice:

- **synthesis_count**: Track voice popularity and ROI
- **last_used_at**: Identify unused voices for cleanup
- **quality_score**: Make data-driven decisions about voice selection

### Integration Examples

```python Python - List and Analyze Voices
import requests

def analyze_voice_usage(assistant_id):
    url = f"https://api.burki.dev/assistants/{assistant_id}/cloned-voices"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    voices = response.json()['cloned_voices']
    
    # Analyze usage patterns
    total_synthesis = sum(voice['synthesis_count'] for voice in voices)
    ready_voices = [v for v in voices if v['status'] == 'ready']
    unused_voices = [v for v in voices if v['synthesis_count'] == 0]
    
    return {
        'total_voices': len(voices),
        'ready_voices': len(ready_voices),
        'unused_voices': len(unused_voices),
        'total_synthesis': total_synthesis
    }
```

```javascript Node.js - Filter High-Quality Voices
async function getHighQualityVoices(assistantId, minQuality = 0.8) {
  const response = await axios.get(
    `https://api.burki.dev/assistants/${assistantId}/cloned-voices?status=ready`,
    {
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
    }
  );
  
  return response.data.cloned_voices.filter(voice => 
    voice.quality_score && voice.quality_score >= minQuality
  );
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check voice status regularly for processing voices
2. **Quality Assessment**: Use quality scores to evaluate voice performance
3. **Usage Tracking**: Monitor synthesis_count to identify popular voices
4. **Cleanup**: Archive or delete unused voices to reduce costs
5. **Provider Comparison**: Compare quality and usage across providers
