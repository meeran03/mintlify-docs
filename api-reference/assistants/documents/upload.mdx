openapi: 'POST /api/v1/assistants/{assistant_id}/documents/upload'
---

This endpoint allows you to upload a document to an assistant's knowledge base for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The document will be processed, chunked, and stored as embeddings in a vector database.

The request must be sent as `multipart/form-data`.

### Path Parameters

- `assistant_id` (string, **required**): The unique identifier of the assistant to whom the document will be added.

### Form Data

- `file` (file, **required**): The document to upload. Supported file types include `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.md`, and `.docx`.

### Response

A successful request will immediately return a document object with a `processing` status. The document will be processed in the background. You can check the status later using the [Get Document Status](/api-reference/assistants/documents/get-status) endpoint.
