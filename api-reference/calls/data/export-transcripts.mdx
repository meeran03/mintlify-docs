This endpoint allows you to export the full transcript of a specific call to a file. You can choose from several formats.

The response from this endpoint will be a file download.

### Path Parameters

### Query Parameters

- `format` (string, optional, default: `txt`): The desired file format.
  - Allowed values: `txt`, `json`, `csv`.
- `speaker` (string, optional): Filter transcripts to include only a specific speaker (`user` or `assistant`).

### Response Formats

**If `format=txt`:**

You will receive a plain text file (`.txt`) with the conversation formatted for readability.

```

**If `format=json`:**

You will receive a JSON file (`.json`) containing an array of transcript objects.
