title: 'Export Calls'
openapi: 'GET /api/v1/calls/export'
---

This endpoint allows you to export a list of calls to either a CSV or JSON file. It supports a subset of the filtering options available on the [List Calls](/api-reference/calls/list) endpoint.

The response from this endpoint will be a file download.

### Query Parameters

- `format` (string, optional, default: `csv`): The desired file format. Can be `csv` or `json`.
- `status` (string, optional): Filter calls by their status.
- `assistant_id` (integer, optional): Filter calls by a specific assistant.
- `date_from` (string, optional): Filter calls from this date (ISO 8601 format).
- `date_to` (string, optional): Filter calls to this date (ISO 8601 format).

### Response

The response is not a JSON object in the traditional sense, but a file that your browser will prompt you to download.

**If `format=csv`:**

You will receive a `text/csv` file named `calls_export.csv`.

```csv CSV Content
"Call ID","Call SID","Assistant Name","Customer Phone","Status","Duration (seconds)","Started At","Ended At"
101,"CA...","Support Bot","+1555...","completed",300,"2023-10-30T10:00:00","2023-10-30T10:05:00"

```

**If `format=json`:**

You will receive an `application/json` file named `calls_export.json` containing an array of call objects.
