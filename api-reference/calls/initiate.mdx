title: 'Initiate Call'
openapi: 'POST /calls/initiate'
---

Programmatically initiate an outbound call from one of your AI assistants to a phone number.

This is one of the most powerful features of Burki - it allows you to trigger AI-powered outbound calls from your application logic, enabling use cases like appointment reminders, lead follow-ups, and proactive customer outreach.

## How It Works

1. **You send a request** with the source phone number, destination number, and optional customization
2. **Burki resolves the assistant** based on your parameters
3. **The call is placed** through your configured telephony provider (Twilio, Telnyx, Vonage, or SIP)
4. **Your AI assistant** handles the conversation automatically

<Info>
**Multi-Provider Support**: This endpoint works with Twilio, Telnyx, Vonage, and BYO SIP Trunk. The system automatically uses the provider configured for the specified `from_phone_number`.

## Request Body

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `from_phone_number` | string | Yes | Phone number to call from (E.164 format). Must be assigned to an assistant in your organization. |
| `to_phone_number` | string | Yes | Destination phone number (E.164 format). |
| `assistant_id` | integer | No | Override the default assistant. If not provided, uses the assistant assigned to `from_phone_number`. |
| `welcome_message` | string | No | Custom greeting for this call. Supports `{{variable}}` template syntax. |
| `agenda` | string | No | Call objective/context for the AI. Supports `{{variable}}` template syntax. |
| `variables` | object | No | Key-value pairs for template substitution in `welcome_message` and `agenda`. |

### Assistant Resolution

The system determines which assistant handles the call:

1. **If `assistant_id` is provided**: Uses that specific assistant
2. **If phone number has a direct assistant**: Uses the assigned assistant
3. **If phone number has an assistant graph**: Uses the graph's entry point assistant
