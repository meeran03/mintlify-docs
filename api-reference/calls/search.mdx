This endpoint allows you to perform a full-text search across your call records. The search will look for matches in fields like assistant name, phone numbers, and transcript content.

### Query Parameters

- `q` (string, **required**): The search query. Must be at least 3 characters long.
- `limit` (integer, optional, default: 50): The maximum number of search results to return.

### Response

The response is a JSON array of call objects that match the search query. The structure of each call object is the same as the one returned by the [List Calls](/api-reference/calls/list) endpoint.
