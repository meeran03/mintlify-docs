title: 'Terminate Call'
openapi: 'POST /api/v1/calls/{call_sid}/terminate'
---

Immediately terminate an ongoing call. This endpoint allows you to programmatically hang up a call that is currently in progress.

## Use Cases

- **Admin intervention**: Manually end calls that need immediate termination
- **Automatic cutoff**: End calls when certain conditions are met (e.g., time limits, budget caps)
- **Emergency stop**: Quickly terminate all active calls during system maintenance
- **Quality control**: End calls that are not meeting quality standards

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `call_sid` | string | Yes | The unique call SID (Session ID) from your telephony provider |

## Request

This endpoint does not require a request body.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/calls/CAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/terminate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Response

### Success (200 OK)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Call terminated successfully via twilio"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `success` | boolean | Whether the termination was successful |
| `message` | string | Status message including the provider used |

## Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request

Returned when the call is not in an "ongoing" status.

```json
{
  "detail": "Cannot terminate call - current status is 'completed'"
}
```

### 404 Not Found

Returned when the call doesn't exist or doesn't belong to your organization.

```json
{
  "detail": "Call not found or you don't have permission to terminate it"
}
```

### 500 Internal Server Error

Returned when the telephony provider fails to terminate the call.

```json
{
  "detail": "Failed to terminate call via twilio"
}
```

## Provider Support

This endpoint works with all supported telephony providers:

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Twilio | Uses Twilio's call update API |
| Telnyx | Uses Telnyx Call Control API |
| Vonage | Uses Vonage Voice API |
| BYO SIP Trunk | Uses SIP CANCEL/BYE signaling |

The system automatically detects which provider to use based on the call's metadata.

## Examples

### Python

```python
import requests

def terminate_call(call_sid):
    response = requests.post(
        f"https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/calls/{call_sid}/terminate",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
    )
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Call {call_sid} terminated successfully")
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to terminate: {response.json()['detail']}")
        return None
```

### Node.js

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function terminateCall(callSid) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      `https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/calls/${callSid}/terminate`,
      {},
      {
        headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
      }
    );
    
    console.log('Call terminated:', response.data);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to terminate:', error.response.data.detail);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Terminate All Active Calls

```python
import requests

def terminate_all_active_calls():
    # First, get all ongoing calls
    calls_response = requests.get(
        "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/calls",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"},
        params={"status": "ongoing"}
    )
    
    ongoing_calls = calls_response.json()["items"]
    
    # Terminate each one
    for call in ongoing_calls:
        terminate_call(call["call_sid"])
        print(f"Terminated call {call['call_sid']}")
```

## Notes

- The call status will be updated to "completed" in the database after termination
- Call duration is calculated up to the termination time
- Billing is recorded for the portion of the call that occurred
- Termination is immediate - there is no graceful hangup message by default
