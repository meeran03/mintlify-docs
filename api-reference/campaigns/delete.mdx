### Path Parameters

### What Gets Deleted

When you delete a campaign, the following data is permanently removed:

- Campaign configuration and settings
- All imported contacts
- Execution history and logs
- Schedule configurations
- Import history records

### Example Code

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/campaigns/42" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.delete(
    "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/campaigns/42",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Campaign deleted successfully")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.json()}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/campaigns/42", {
  method: "DELETE",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
});

if (response.ok) {
  console.log("Campaign deleted successfully");
} else {
  const error = await response.json();
  console.error("Error:", error);
}
```

### Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Cannot delete running campaign - stop it first |
| 404 | Campaign not found |
| 401 | Unauthorized - invalid or missing API key |

### Best Practices

- **Export data first** if you need to keep records of the campaign results
- **Stop running campaigns** before attempting to delete
- **Consider pausing** instead of deleting if you might need the campaign later
