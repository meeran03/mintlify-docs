const response = await fetch("https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/campaigns/42/re-execute", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    contact_selection: "failed_only",
    schedule_settings: {
      schedule_type: "immediate"
    }
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(`Reset ${result.contacts_reset} contacts for re-execution`);
```

### Behavior

When re-executing a campaign:

1. **Selected contacts** are reset to `pending` status
2. **Non-selected contacts** are marked as `skipped`
3. **Campaign counters** are reset to 0
4. **Metrics** are cleared for fresh tracking
5. **Execution history** is preserved for audit
6. **Campaign status** becomes `draft` (immediate) or `scheduled`

### Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Campaign status doesn't allow re-execution |
| 400 | No contacts match the selection criteria |
| 400 | Scheduled time is in the past |
| 404 | Campaign not found |

### Valid Starting Statuses

Re-execution is only available for:
- `completed` - All contacts processed
- `cancelled` - Campaign was stopped
- `failed` - Campaign encountered an error
