title: 'Stop Campaign'
openapi: 'POST /api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/stop'
---

Stop (cancel) a campaign permanently. Use this to terminate a running, paused, or scheduled campaign.

<Callout type="warning">
Stopping a campaign marks all remaining pending contacts as cancelled. Use pause if you plan to resume later.
</Callout>

### Path Parameters

- `campaign_id` (integer, required): The unique identifier of the campaign

### Behavior

When you stop a campaign:
- Campaign status changes to `cancelled`
- **In-progress calls** may complete (provider-dependent)
- **Pending contacts** are marked as cancelled
- **Completion timestamp** is recorded
- Campaign cannot be resumed (use re-execute for new run)

### Valid Starting Statuses

You can stop campaigns that are:
- `running` - Currently executing
- `paused` - Temporarily paused
- `scheduled` - Waiting to start

### Response

```json Response
{
  "message": "Campaign stopped successfully"
}
```

### Example Code

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/campaigns/42/stop" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/campaigns/42/stop",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Campaign stopped successfully")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.json()}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/campaigns/42/stop", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
});

if (response.ok) {
  console.log("Campaign stopped successfully");
} else {
  const error = await response.json();
  console.error("Error:", error);
}
```

### Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Campaign cannot be stopped (invalid status) |
| 404 | Campaign not found |

### Pause vs Stop

| Action | Resume Possible | Status | Use Case |
|--------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| **Pause** | Yes | `paused` | Temporary break, plan to continue |
| **Stop** | No | `cancelled` | Permanent termination |

### Re-running a Stopped Campaign

To run a stopped campaign again, use the [Re-execute Campaign](/api-reference/campaigns/re-execute) endpoint to reset contacts and start fresh.
