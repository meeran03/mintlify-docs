The Burki Voice AI API allows you to programmatically manage assistants, calls, and other resources in your organization. You can use it to build powerful integrations and automate your voice AI workflows.

This API is built on REST principles and uses standard HTTP response codes and authentication. All API responses are returned in JSON format.

## Authentication

All Burki API endpoints are protected and require a valid API key to be included in all requests. Authentication is performed by passing a **Bearer Token** in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests.

You can generate and manage your API keys from the **API Keys** section in your organization's dashboard.

### How to Use Your API Key

To authenticate an API request, you must include an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`, where `YOUR_API_KEY` is the key you generated in the dashboard.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/assistants" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/assistants", 
    headers=headers
)

print(response.json())
```

```javascript Node.js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

fetch('https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/assistants', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Treat your API keys like passwords! Do not share them publicly or commit them to version control.
</Warning>

### Error Codes

If your API key is missing, invalid, or expired, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response code.
