title: 'Sync Phone Numbers'
openapi: 'POST /api/v1/assistants/organization/phone-numbers/sync'
---

This endpoint triggers a synchronization process with your linked Twilio account. It fetches all phone numbers from Twilio and adds any numbers that are not already present in your organization's database.

This is useful for ensuring that your local database is up-to-date with the phone numbers available in your Twilio account. The request does not require a body.

### Response

A successful sync will return a JSON object confirming the operation and stating how many new numbers were added.

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully synced 3 phone numbers from Twilio",
  "synced_count": 3
}
```
