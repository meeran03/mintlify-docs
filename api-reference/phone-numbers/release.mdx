title: 'Release Phone Number'
openapi: 'POST /phone-numbers/release'
---

This endpoint allows you to release (delete) a phone number from your Twilio or Telnyx account, making it available for others to purchase. The number is immediately removed from your account and all associated configurations are cleaned up.

## How It Works

1. **Provider Detection**: The system automatically detects which provider owns the number
2. **Account Removal**: The number is released from your telephony provider account
3. **Database Cleanup**: The number is removed from your organization's inventory
4. **Immediate Effect**: The number stops receiving calls and messages instantly

<Warning>
**Permanent Action**: Once released, a phone number cannot be recovered. The number becomes available for others to purchase and you cannot guarantee getting it back.
</Warning>

## Request Body

The request body is a JSON object containing release details.

- `phone_number` (string, **required**): The phone number to release in E.164 format
- `provider` (string, optional): Provider to use (`"twilio"` or `"telnyx"`). Auto-detected if not provided

```json Request
{
  "phone_number": "+14155551234",
  "provider": "telnyx"
}
```

### Auto-Detection Example

```json Request
{
  "phone_number": "+14155551234"
}
```

<Info>
**Provider Auto-Detection**: If you don't specify a provider, the system will automatically detect which provider owns the number based on your database records.
</Info>

## Response

A successful request returns a `200 OK` status with release confirmation.

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "phone_number": "+14155551234",
  "provider": "telnyx",
  "message": "Successfully released phone number +14155551234 from telnyx"
}
```

## Response Fields

- `success` (boolean): Whether the release completed successfully
- `phone_number` (string): The released phone number
- `provider` (string): Provider from which the number was released
- `message` (string): Human-readable confirmation message

## Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request

Returned when the request contains invalid data.

```json
{
  "detail": "Provider must be 'twilio' or 'telnyx'"
}
```

Common causes:
- Invalid `provider` value
- Invalid phone number format
- Number not in E.164 format

### 404 Not Found

Returned when the phone number is not found.

```json
{
  "detail": "Phone number +14155551234 not found in database"
}
```

This occurs when:
- Number doesn't exist in your account
- Number was never purchased through Burki
- Number already released

### 500 Internal Server Error

Returned when the release fails at the provider level.

```json
{
  "detail": "Failed to release phone number from telnyx"
}
```

Common causes:
- Provider API error
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid provider credentials
- Number has active calls/usage

## Release Workflow

### Standard Release Process

```bash
# 1. List your current numbers (optional)
curl -X GET "https://api.burki.dev/organization/phonenumbers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# 2. Release a specific number
curl -X POST "https://api.burki.dev/phone-numbers/release" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phone_number": "+14155551234"
  }'

# 3. Number is immediately unavailable
```

### Bulk Release Process

```bash
# Release multiple numbers
for number in "+14155551234" "+14155551235" "+14155551236"; do
  curl -X POST "https://api.burki.dev/phone-numbers/release" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"phone_number\": \"$number\"}"
done
```

## Use Cases

### Cost Optimization

Release unused numbers to reduce monthly costs:

```json
{
  "phone_number": "+14155551234"
}
```

### Account Cleanup

Remove test or temporary numbers:

```json
{
  "phone_number": "+18005551234",
  "provider": "twilio"
}
```

### Geographic Reorganization

Release numbers when closing regional offices:

```json
{
  "phone_number": "+12125551234"
}
```

### Provider Migration

Release numbers before switching providers:

```json
{
  "phone_number": "+14155551234",
  "provider": "twilio"
}
```

## Provider Behavior

### Twilio Release

- **Immediate Deactivation**: Number stops working instantly
- **Billing**: Pro-rated refund may apply (check Twilio terms)
- **Reactivation**: Number returns to Twilio's available pool
- **Dependencies**: All webhooks and configurations are removed

### Telnyx Release

- **Immediate Deactivation**: Number stops working instantly
- **Billing**: Check Telnyx terms for refund policies
- **Reactivation**: Number returns to available inventory
- **Order Status**: Associated orders marked as released

## Safety Considerations

### Pre-Release Checklist

Before releasing a number, ensure:

1. **No Active Calls**: Number isn't currently handling calls
2. **No Dependencies**: No critical integrations depend on this number
3. **Customer Communication**: Customers are notified of number changes
4. **Documentation Updated**: Internal docs reflect the change
5. **Backup Plan**: Alternative contact methods are available

### Impact Assessment

Releasing a number affects:

- **Incoming Calls**: All incoming calls will fail
- **SMS Messages**: SMS/MMS will not be delivered
- **Assistant Assignment**: Associated assistant becomes unreachable
- **Customer Experience**: Customers lose ability to contact you

## Integration Examples

### Node.js

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function releasePhoneNumber(phoneNumber, provider = null) {
  try {
    const requestData = { phone_number: phoneNumber };
    if (provider) {
      requestData.provider = provider;
    }

    const response = await axios.post('https://api.burki.dev/phone-numbers/release', requestData, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    
    console.log(`Successfully released ${phoneNumber} from ${response.data.provider}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Release failed:', error.response.data);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Usage with auto-detection
await releasePhoneNumber('+14155551234');

// Usage with explicit provider
await releasePhoneNumber('+14155551234', 'telnyx');
```

### Python

```python
import requests

def release_phone_number(phone_number, provider=None):
    url = "https://api.burki.dev/phone-numbers/release"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    payload = {"phone_number": phone_number}
    if provider:
        payload["provider"] = provider
    
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Release failed: {response.json()['detail']}")

# Usage examples
result = release_phone_number("+14155551234")  # Auto-detect provider
result = release_phone_number("+14155551234", "telnyx")  # Explicit provider
```

### PHP

```php
<?php
function releasePhoneNumber($phoneNumber, $provider = null) {
    $url = 'https://api.burki.dev/phone-numbers/release';
    $headers = [
        'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type: application/json'
    ];
    
    $data = ['phone_number' => $phoneNumber];
    if ($provider) {
        $data['provider'] = $provider;
    }
    
    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($data));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    
    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    $httpCode = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
    curl_close($ch);
    
    if ($httpCode === 200) {
        return json_decode($response, true);
    } else {
        throw new Exception("Release failed: " . $response);
    }
}

// Usage
$result = releasePhoneNumber('+14155551234');
?>
```

## Batch Operations

### Release Multiple Numbers

```javascript
async function releaseMultipleNumbers(phoneNumbers) {
  const results = [];
  
  for (const phoneNumber of phoneNumbers) {
    try {
      const result = await releasePhoneNumber(phoneNumber);
      results.push({ phoneNumber, success: true, result });
    } catch (error) {
      results.push({ phoneNumber, success: false, error: error.message });
    }
  }
  
  return results;
}

// Usage
const numbersToRelease = ['+14155551234', '+14155551235', '+14155551236'];
const results = await releaseMultipleNumbers(numbersToRelease);
```

### Conditional Release

```python
def release_unused_numbers(unused_threshold_days=30):
    """Release numbers that haven't been used for calls in X days"""
    
    # Get list of numbers and their last usage
    numbers = get_phone_number_usage()
    
    for number_info in numbers:
        if number_info['days_since_last_call'] > unused_threshold_days:
            try:
                result = release_phone_number(number_info['phone_number'])
                print(f"Released unused number: {number_info['phone_number']}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Failed to release {number_info['phone_number']}: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

### Planning and Preparation

1. **Audit First**: Review which numbers are actually needed
2. **Usage Analysis**: Check call/SMS volume before releasing
3. **Customer Impact**: Assess impact on customer communications
4. **Gradual Release**: Release numbers in phases, not all at once

### Error Handling

```javascript
async function safeRelease(phoneNumber) {
  try {
    // Check if number has recent activity
    const usage = await checkNumberUsage(phoneNumber);
    if (usage.recentCalls > 0) {
      throw new Error('Number has recent activity, release cancelled');
    }
    
    return await releasePhoneNumber(phoneNumber);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to release ${phoneNumber}:`, error.message);
    // Log to monitoring system
    // Send alert to admin
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Cost Management

1. **Regular Audits**: Monthly review of number usage
2. **Automated Cleanup**: Script to release unused numbers
3. **Approval Process**: Require approval for number releases
4. **Recovery Planning**: Consider number porting instead of release

### Documentation

Always document releases:
- Which numbers were released
- Reason for release
- Date and time
- Impact assessment
- Rollback plan (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Number not found" | Number not in account | Verify number ownership |
| "Release failed" | Provider API error | Check provider status |
| "Active usage" | Number currently in use | Wait for calls to complete |
| "Permission denied" | Insufficient privileges | Check API key permissions |

### Recovery Options

If you accidentally release a critical number:

1. **Immediate Search**: Search for the number in available pools
2. **Quick Purchase**: Purchase it back if still available
3. **Alternative Numbers**: Find similar numbers in the same area
4. **Customer Communication**: Notify customers of temporary number changes

### Monitoring

Set up monitoring for:
- Number release events
- Failed release attempts
- Usage patterns before release
- Customer impact metrics

<Info>
**Best Practice**: Always test the release process with non-critical numbers first to understand the full impact and timing.
