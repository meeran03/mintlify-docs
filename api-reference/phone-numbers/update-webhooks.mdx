## Overview

Update voice webhook URLs and optionally disable SMS webhooks for a phone number. 

**Important**: SMS webhook URLs are managed automatically through assistant assignment. This endpoint only allows you to disable SMS webhooks when needed.

## Request Body

- `phone_number` (string, **required**): The phone number to update in E.164 format (e.g., `+1234567890`)
- `voice_webhook_url` (string, optional): URL for voice call webhooks
- `disable_sms` (boolean, optional): Set to `true` to disable SMS webhooks. Default: `false`
- `enable_sms` (boolean, optional): Set to `true` to enable SMS webhooks based on assigned assistant. Default: `false`
- `provider` (string, optional): Provider (`twilio` or `telnyx`). Auto-detected if not provided

**Note**: You cannot set both `disable_sms` and `enable_sms` to `true` in the same request.

## SMS Webhook Management

SMS webhooks are automatically configured when you assign a phone number to an assistant with an `sms_webhook_url`. Use this endpoint to temporarily disable SMS handling:

### Disabling SMS Webhooks

```json Request - Disable SMS
{
  "phone_number": "+15551234567",
  "disable_sms": true
}
```

**What happens when SMS is disabled:**
- **Twilio**: Sets SMS webhook to `https://demo.twilio.com/welcome/sms/reply`
- **Telnyx**: Sets SMS webhook to empty URL
- **Result**: Incoming SMS messages are ignored

### Re-enabling SMS Webhooks

```json Request - Enable SMS
{
  "phone_number": "+15551234567",
  "enable_sms": true
}
```

**What happens when SMS is enabled:**
- **Prerequisites**: Phone number must be assigned to an assistant with `sms_webhook_url` configured
- **Twilio**: Sets SMS webhook to `/twilio-sms-webhook` and enables messaging service
- **Telnyx**: Sets SMS webhook to `/telnyx-webhook`
- **Result**: SMS messages are forwarded to assistant's `sms_webhook_url`

### Updating Voice Webhooks

```json Request - Update Voice Webhook
{
  "phone_number": "+15551234567",
  "voice_webhook_url": "https://your-app.com/voice-webhook"
}
```

### Combined Updates

```json Request - Update Voice + Disable SMS
{
  "phone_number": "+15551234567",
  "voice_webhook_url": "https://your-app.com/voice-webhook",
  "disable_sms": true
}
```

```json Request - Update Voice + Enable SMS
{
  "phone_number": "+15551234567",
  "voice_webhook_url": "https://your-app.com/voice-webhook",
  "enable_sms": true
}
```

## Response

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "phone_number": "+15551234567",
  "provider": "twilio",
  "updated_webhooks": {
    "voice": "https://your-app.com/voice-webhook",
    "sms": "disabled (demo URL)"
  },
  "message": "Successfully updated 2 webhook(s) for +15551234567 via twilio"
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Voice webhook updates** - Change where voice call events are sent
2. **Temporary SMS disable** - Disable SMS during maintenance or testing
3. **Emergency SMS disable** - Quickly stop SMS processing if needed
4. **Re-enable SMS after maintenance** - Restore SMS functionality without reassigning phone numbers

## Notes

- At least one of `voice_webhook_url`, `disable_sms`, or `enable_sms` must be provided
- Cannot set both `disable_sms` and `enable_sms` to `true` in the same request
- To enable SMS, the phone number must be assigned to an assistant with `sms_webhook_url` configured
- Voice webhooks can be updated independently of SMS webhook state
