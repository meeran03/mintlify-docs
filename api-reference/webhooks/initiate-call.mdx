title: 'Initiate Outbound Call'
openapi: 'POST /calls/initiate'
---

This endpoint is used to programmatically initiate an outbound call from one of your AI assistants to an external phone number. It is a system endpoint that you call from your own application logic, not a webhook for an external service.

When you call this endpoint, it instructs Twilio to place a call. Twilio then makes a request to your `/twiml` webhook, passing along the parameters you provide here as metadata. This allows the system to route the call to the correct assistant and begin the conversation.

### Request Body

The request body is a JSON object specifying the details of the outbound call.

- `assistant_id` (integer, **required**): The ID of the assistant that should make the call.
- `to_phone_number` (string, **required**): The destination phone number to call, in E.164 format.
- `welcome_message` (string, optional): A custom welcome message for the assistant to say at the beginning of the call. If not provided, the assistant's default greeting will be used.
- `agenda` (string, optional): A specific topic or goal for the call. This can be used to guide the assistant's conversation.

```json Request
{
  "assistant_id": 123,
  "to_phone_number": "+15559876543",
  "welcome_message": "Hello, this is a reminder about your appointment tomorrow at 10 AM.",
  "agenda": "Remind the user about their upcoming appointment."
}
```

### Response

A successful request will return a `200 OK` status with a JSON object containing the `call_sid` from Twilio, confirming that the call has been initiated.

```json Response
{
  "message": "Call initiated successfully",
  "call_sid": "CAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```
