title: 'Initiate Outbound Call'
openapi: 'POST /calls/initiate'
---

This endpoint is used to programmatically initiate an outbound call from one of your AI assistants to an external phone number. It is a system endpoint that you call from your own application logic, not a webhook for an external service.

When you call this endpoint, it instructs Twilio to place a call. Twilio then makes a request to your `/twiml` webhook, passing along the parameters you provide here as metadata. This allows the system to route the call to the correct assistant and begin the conversation.

### Request Body

The request body is a JSON object specifying the details of the outbound call.

- `assistant_id` (integer, **required**): The ID of the assistant that should make the call.
- `to_phone_number` (string, **required**): The destination phone number to call, in E.164 format.
- `welcome_message` (string, optional): A custom welcome message for the assistant to say at the beginning of the call. If not provided, the assistant's default greeting will be used. Supports variable substitution using `{{variable}}` syntax.
- `agenda` (string, optional): A specific topic or goal for the call. This can be used to guide the assistant's conversation. Supports variable substitution using `{{variable}}` syntax.
- `variables` (object, optional): A dictionary of custom variables for template substitution in the welcome_message and agenda. Variables can be referenced using double curly brackets, e.g., `{{name}}`, `{{company}}`, etc.
