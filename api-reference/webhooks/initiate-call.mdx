title: 'Initiate Outbound Call'
openapi: 'POST /calls/initiate'
---

This endpoint is used to programmatically initiate an outbound call from one of your AI assistants to an external phone number. It is a system endpoint that you call from your own application logic, not a webhook for an external service.

When you call this endpoint, Burki instructs your telephony provider (Twilio, Telnyx, or Vonage) to place a call. The provider then makes a request to your webhook, passing along the parameters you provide here as metadata. This allows the system to route the call to the correct assistant and begin the conversation.

<Info>
**Multi-Provider Support**: This endpoint works with Twilio, Telnyx, Vonage, and BYO SIP Trunk. The system automatically uses the provider configured for the specified `from_phone_number`.
</Info>

## Request Body

The request body is a JSON object specifying the details of the outbound call.

### Required Parameters

- `from_phone_number` (string, **required**): The phone number to call from, in E.164 format. This number must be assigned to an assistant or assistant graph in your organization.
- `to_phone_number` (string, **required**): The destination phone number to call, in E.164 format.

### Optional Parameters

- `assistant_id` (integer, optional): Override the default assistant attached to the phone number. If not provided, the system uses the assistant assigned to `from_phone_number`.
- `welcome_message` (string, optional): A custom welcome message for the assistant to say at the beginning of the call. If not provided, the assistant's default greeting will be used. Supports variable substitution using `{{variable}}` syntax.
- `agenda` (string, optional): A specific topic or goal for the call. This can be used to guide the assistant's conversation. Supports variable substitution using `{{variable}}` syntax.
- `variables` (object, optional): A dictionary of custom variables for template substitution in the `welcome_message` and `agenda`. Variables can be referenced using double curly brackets, e.g., `{{name}}`, `{{company}}`, etc.

### Assistant Resolution Logic

The system determines which assistant handles the call using the following priority:

1. **If `assistant_id` is provided**: Use the specified assistant (must belong to your organization)
2. **If `from_phone_number` is assigned to an assistant**: Use that assistant
3. **If `from_phone_number` is assigned to an assistant graph**: Use the entry point assistant from the graph

<Warning>
If no assistant can be resolved through the above logic, the request will fail with a 404 error.
</Warning>

  "to_phone_number": "+15559876543",
  "assistant_id": 456,
  "welcome_message": "Hi there! I'm calling about your recent inquiry."
}
```
