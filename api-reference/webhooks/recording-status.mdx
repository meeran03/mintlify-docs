title: 'Recording Status Webhook'
openapi: 'POST /recording-status'
---

This webhook is designed to receive status updates from Twilio about call recordings. When you enable call recording on your Twilio account or for a specific call, Twilio will automatically make a `POST` request to this endpoint once the recording is processed and available.

Its primary function is to receive the recording metadata from Twilio and update the corresponding call record in your database with the recording URL, duration, and other details.

### Request from Twilio

This endpoint consumes `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data sent by Twilio. The following are the key parameters:

- `CallSid` (string): The unique identifier of the call that was recorded. This is used to look up the call in your database.
- `RecordingSid` (string): A unique identifier for the recording itself.
- `RecordingUrl` (string): The URL where the recording's audio file can be accessed. This URL will be stored in your database.
- `RecordingDuration` (string): The duration of the recording in seconds.
- `RecordingStatus` (string): The status of the recording, typically `completed`.

### Response to Twilio

The endpoint responds with a `200 OK` status and a simple confirmation message to acknowledge receipt of the data. The response body is not typically used by Twilio.

```json Response
{
  "message": "Recording status updated"
