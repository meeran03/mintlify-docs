## How It Works

When a call uses a provider service, Burki checks for API keys in this order:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Need Provider API Key] --> B{Assistant-level BYO key?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Use Assistant's BYO Key]
    B -->|No| D{Organization-level key?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Use Organization Key]
    D -->|No| F[Use Burki Managed Key]
```

1. **Assistant-level BYO keys** (highest priority)
2. **Organization-level credentials**
3. **System default keys** (Burki managed)

This allows you to use BYO keys for specific assistants while others use managed keys.

## Configuration

### TTS Provider Keys

Add BYO keys in your assistant's TTS settings:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ElevenLabs">
    ```json
    {
      "tts_settings": {
        "provider": "elevenlabs",
        "byo_api_keys": {
          "elevenlabs": {
            "api_key": "your-elevenlabs-api-key"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Deepgram">
    ```json
    {
      "tts_settings": {
        "provider": "deepgram",
        "byo_api_keys": {
          "deepgram": {
            "api_key": "your-deepgram-api-key"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cartesia">
    ```json
    {
      "tts_settings": {
        "provider": "cartesia",
        "byo_api_keys": {
          "cartesia": {
            "api_key": "your-cartesia-api-key"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenAI">
    ```json
    {
      "tts_settings": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "byo_api_keys": {
          "openai": {
            "api_key": "your-openai-api-key"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### STT Provider Keys

Add BYO keys in your assistant's STT settings:

```json
{
  "stt_settings": {
    "provider": "deepgram",
    "byo_api_keys": {
      "deepgram": {
        "api_key": "your-deepgram-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Azure Speech (Special Configuration)

Azure Speech requires both an API key and a region:

```json
{
  "tts_settings": {
    "provider": "azure",
    "byo_api_keys": {
      "azure": {
        "api_key": "your-azure-speech-key",
        "region": "eastus"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
Azure region must match where your Speech resource is deployed. Common regions: `eastus`, `westus2`, `westeurope`, `southeastasia`.
</Callout>

### Inworld (Bearer Token)

Inworld uses a bearer token and workspace ID:

```json
{
  "tts_settings": {
    "provider": "inworld",
    "byo_api_keys": {
      "inworld": {
        "bearer_token": "your-inworld-bearer-token",
        "workspace_id": "your-workspace-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Dashboard Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Assistant Settings">
    Navigate to your assistant's configuration page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Voice Settings">
    Find the TTS or STT configuration section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable BYO Keys">
    Toggle "Use my own API key" or similar option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Credentials">
    Paste your API key (and region if required).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Test">
    Save settings and make a test call to verify.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security

Your API keys are protected with enterprise-grade security:

<Accordion title="Encryption at Rest">
All API keys are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before storage. Keys are decrypted only when needed for API calls and never stored in plaintext.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Never Exposed in API">
BYO API keys are never returned in API responses. When you retrieve assistant settings, key fields show masked values like `***...***` or are omitted entirely.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audit Logging">
Key usage is logged for security auditing:
- When keys are added or updated
- Which services use which keys
- Failed authentication attempts
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Secure Transmission">
All API calls using your keys are made over HTTPS/TLS 1.3. Keys are transmitted securely to provider endpoints.
</Accordion>

---

## Cost Implications

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="BYO Keys">
    **You pay the provider directly:**
    - Direct billing from ElevenLabs, Deepgram, etc.
    - Your negotiated rates apply
    - No markup from Burki on provider costs
    - Burki charges only platform fees
    
    **Best for:**
    - High volume usage
    - Existing enterprise agreements
    - Organizations requiring direct vendor relationships
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Managed Keys">
    **Burki provides and bills:**
    - Pass-through costs + 15% markup
    - Single invoice from Burki
    - No need to manage multiple vendor accounts
    - Included usage tracking and analytics
    
    **Best for:**
    - Getting started quickly
    - Lower volume usage
    - Simplified billing
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid">
    **Mix and match:**
    - Use BYO keys for high-volume providers
    - Use managed for occasional services
    - Different settings per assistant
    
    **Example:**
    - BYO: ElevenLabs (high TTS volume)
    - Managed: Deepgram STT (lower volume)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing Your Keys

After configuring BYO keys, verify they work:

### Quick Test

1. Make a test call to your assistant
2. Check the call logs for provider usage
3. Verify the call completed successfully
4. Check your provider dashboard for the corresponding API call

### Common Issues

<Accordion title="Invalid API Key">
**Symptom:** Calls fail immediately or fall back to managed keys

**Solution:**
- Verify the key is correct (no extra spaces)
- Check key hasn't expired
- Confirm key has required permissions
- Ensure key is for the correct environment (production vs. sandbox)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Wrong Region (Azure)">
**Symptom:** Azure calls fail with region errors

**Solution:**
- Match region exactly to your Azure Speech resource
- Use lowercase (e.g., `eastus` not `East US`)
- Check Azure portal for the correct region name
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
**Symptom:** Some calls succeed, others fail

**Solution:**
- Check your provider's rate limits
- Upgrade your provider plan if needed
- Consider spreading load across multiple keys
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient Permissions">
**Symptom:** Specific operations fail

**Solution:**
- Verify API key has access to required services
- For ElevenLabs: Ensure voice cloning permissions if using cloned voices
- For Deepgram: Check STT and TTS are both enabled if using both
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

- **Rotate keys periodically**: Update API keys every 90 days for security
- **Use separate keys**: Create dedicated keys for Burki rather than sharing with other applications
- **Monitor usage**: Check provider dashboards regularly for unexpected usage
- **Set up alerts**: Configure billing alerts with your providers
- **Test after changes**: Always verify calls work after updating keys
- **Keep backups**: Store keys securely in a password manager

<Callout type="tip">
When testing BYO keys, start with a low-volume assistant before rolling out to production traffic. This catches configuration issues without impacting critical workloads.

## API Reference

### Setting BYO Keys via API

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/assistants/{assistant_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tts_settings": {
      "provider": "elevenlabs",
      "byo_api_keys": {
        "elevenlabs": {
          "api_key": "your-elevenlabs-key"
        }
      }
    },
    "stt_settings": {
      "provider": "deepgram",
      "byo_api_keys": {
        "deepgram": {
          "api_key": "your-deepgram-key"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Removing BYO Keys

To revert to managed keys, set `byo_api_keys` to `null` or an empty object:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/assistants/{assistant_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tts_settings": {
      "byo_api_keys": null
    }
  }'
```

<Callout type="note">
BYO keys are not included in assistant export/import to prevent accidental key exposure. Re-enter keys after importing an assistant.
