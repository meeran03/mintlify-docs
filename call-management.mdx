## What is Call Management?

Call Management controls the **conversation flow** during phone calls. It's separate from AI Configuration (which handles what the AI says) - this section controls **when** and **how** the AI responds to callers.

<Card title="🚦 Call Management = Conversation Traffic Control" icon="traffic-light">
  Just like traffic lights control car flow, these settings control conversation flow between your AI assistant and callers.

## Interruption Settings

<Callout type="warning">
**Most Important Section**: These settings directly affect how natural your conversations feel!
</Callout>

### Interruption Threshold
<Accordion title="What does 'Interruption Threshold' mean?">
**Simple Explanation**: How many words a caller needs to say before the AI stops talking and listens.

**Technical Details**:
- **Measured in**: Number of words
- **Default**: 3 words
- **Range**: 1-10 words (recommended)

**Real Example**:
- Threshold = 3: Caller says "Wait, I have a..." → AI stops talking
- Threshold = 1: Caller says "Um..." → AI stops talking (very sensitive)
- Threshold = 5: Caller says "Actually, I need to tell you..." → AI stops talking

**When to Adjust**:
- **Lower (1-2 words)**: For very responsive, human-like conversations
- **Higher (4-5 words)**: For formal business calls where AI should finish sentences
- **Much higher (6+ words)**: For presentations or when AI shouldn't be interrupted

**Technical Note**: The system counts words by splitting text on spaces. Both word count AND min speaking time must be met for a valid interruption.

</Accordion>

### Min Speaking Time
<Accordion title="What is 'Min Speaking Time'?">
**Simple Explanation**: How long the AI must talk before it can be interrupted.

**Technical Details**:
- **Measured in**: Seconds (decimals allowed like 0.5)
- **Default**: 0.5 seconds
- **Range**: 0.1-3.0 seconds (recommended)

**Real Example**:
- Min Speaking Time = 0.5s: AI says "Hello, how can I—" → Caller can interrupt
- Min Speaking Time = 2.0s: AI says "Hello, how can I help you today? I'm here to assist with—" → Now caller can interrupt

**When to Adjust**:
- **Lower (0.1-0.3s)**: For very natural, back-and-forth conversations
- **Higher (1-2s)**: For business calls where AI should complete thoughts
- **Much higher (2-3s)**: For announcements or important information delivery

**Technical Note**: The AI must be speaking for at least this duration before any interruption is considered valid, regardless of word count.

</Accordion>

### Interruption Cooldown
<Accordion title="What is 'Interruption Cooldown'?">
**Simple Explanation**: How long to pause after a caller interrupts before the AI starts talking again.

**Technical Details**:
- **Measured in**: Seconds (decimals allowed)
- **Default**: 2.0 seconds
- **Range**: 0.5-5.0 seconds (recommended)

**Real Example**:
- Cooldown = 2.0s: Caller interrupts → AI pauses for 2 seconds → AI responds with buffered speech
- Cooldown = 0.5s: Very quick responses (might feel rushed)
- Cooldown = 4.0s: Longer pauses (might feel awkward)

**Technical Note**: During cooldown, any additional speech from the caller is buffered and processed together when the cooldown period ends.

**When to Adjust**:
- **Lower (0.5-1s)**: For fast-paced conversations or tech support
- **Higher (3-4s)**: For emotional or sensitive conversations
- **Much higher (5s+)**: For elderly callers or those needing processing time

</Accordion>

<Card title="💡 Interruption Settings Quick Guide" icon="lightbulb">
  **Natural Conversations**: Threshold=2, Speaking=0.3s, Cooldown=1.5s
  
  **Business Formal**: Threshold=4, Speaking=1.0s, Cooldown=2.5s
  
  **Customer Support**: Threshold=3, Speaking=0.5s, Cooldown=2.0s (default)
</Card>

## Timeout Settings

### Idle Timeout
<Accordion title="How does 'Idle Timeout' work?">
**Simple Explanation**: How long to wait for the caller to respond before asking "Are you still there?"

**Technical Details**:
- **Measured in**: Seconds
- **Default**: 30 seconds
- **Range**: 10-120 seconds (recommended)

**Real Example**:
- Timeout = 30s: AI asks question → 30 seconds of silence → AI says idle message
- Timeout = 10s: Very short patience (good for quick interactions)
- Timeout = 60s: Very patient (good for complex questions)

**When to Adjust**:
- **Lower (10-20s)**: For simple, quick interactions
- **Higher (45-60s)**: For complex questions or elderly callers
- **Much higher (90s+)**: For forms or detailed information gathering

**Technical Note**: The timer resets when the caller completes an utterance (speech_final) or when the AI responds with meaningful content.

</Accordion>

### Max Idle Messages
<Accordion title="What are 'Max Idle Messages'?">
**Simple Explanation**: How many "Are you still there?" messages to send before ending the call.

**Technical Details**:
- **Measured in**: Number of messages
- **Default**: 3 messages
- **Range**: 1-5 messages (recommended)

**Real Example**:
- Max = 3: AI asks "Are you there?" → Silence → AI asks again → Silence → AI asks again → Silence → Call ends
- Max = 1: AI asks once, then ends call (not very patient)
- Max = 5: AI is very patient (might annoy callers)

**When to Adjust**:
- **Lower (1-2)**: For business efficiency or when call time is expensive
- **Higher (4-5)**: For customer service or when you don't want to lose calls

</Accordion>

<Card title="⏰ Timeout Settings Quick Guide" icon="clock">
  **Quick Service**: Idle=15s, Max Messages=2
  
  **Standard Support**: Idle=30s, Max Messages=3 (default)
  
  **Patient Service**: Idle=45s, Max Messages=4
</Card>

## Call Control Messages

### End Call Message
<Accordion title="What is the 'End Call Message'?">

### Transfer Call Message
<Accordion title="What is the 'Transfer Call Message'?">
**Simple Explanation**: What the AI says when transferring a caller to a human agent.

**Default**: "Please hold while I transfer your call."

**Examples**:
- Professional: "Let me connect you with a specialist who can help."
- Urgent: "I'm transferring you to our emergency support team now."
- Specific: "Connecting you to our billing department. Please hold."

**Best Practices**:
- Explain WHO they're being transferred to

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Accordion title="🚨 AI keeps getting cut off / sounds robotic">
**Problem**: Interruption threshold too low or min speaking time too short

**Solutions**:
- Increase interruption threshold to 4-5 words
- Increase min speaking time to 1.0-1.5 seconds
- Callers won't interrupt as quickly

**Test**: Make a call and see if AI can complete full sentences
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="😴 AI takes forever to respond / feels unresponsive">
**Problem**: Interruption cooldown too long or threshold too high

**Solutions**:
- Decrease interruption cooldown to 1.0-1.5 seconds
- Decrease interruption threshold to 2-3 words
- AI will feel more responsive and natural

**Test**: Try interrupting mid-sentence - AI should stop and respond quickly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="📞 Calls ending too quickly">
**Problem**: Idle timeout too short or max idle messages too low

**Solutions**:
- Increase idle timeout to 45-60 seconds
- Increase max idle messages to 4-5
- Give callers more time to think and respond

**Test**: Stay silent during a call - should get multiple "are you there?" messages
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="⏰ Calls dragging on too long">
**Problem**: Idle timeout too long or max idle messages too high

**Solutions**:
- Decrease idle timeout to 15-20 seconds
- Decrease max idle messages to 1-2
- Calls will end more efficiently

**Test**: Simulate an unresponsive caller - call should end reasonably quickly

## Best Practices

<Card title="🎯 Golden Rules for Call Management" icon="target">
  1. **Start with defaults** and adjust based on real call feedback
  2. **Test with real users** - your perception differs from callers'
  3. **Match your business style** - formal vs casual affects all settings
  4. **Monitor call recordings** to see where conversations break down
  5. **Adjust gradually** - small changes have big impacts on conversation feel
</Card>

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Tip**: Record yourself having a conversation with your assistant, then listen back. You'll immediately hear what needs adjusting!
