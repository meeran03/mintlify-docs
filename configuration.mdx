## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep system prompts concise">
    Shorter system prompts reduce latency. Focus on essential instructions and personality traits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use appropriate models">
    For simple tasks, faster models (GPT-4o-mini) may be better than more powerful ones.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Configure fallbacks">
    Set up backup providers for critical assistants to ensure reliability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test before going live">
    Use the test call feature to verify your configuration before assigning real phone numbers.
