## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL
- Docker & Docker Compose (for easy development)
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meeran03/burki.git
   cd burki
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment:**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

3. **Run with Docker (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Run database migrations
   alembic upgrade head
   
   # Start the application
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   # Run tests (if available)
   pytest
   
   # Test API endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your changes"
   ```

### Coding Standards

- **Follow PEP 8** for Python code style
- **Use type hints** where possible
- **Add docstrings** to functions and classes
- **Keep functions focused** and modular
- **Use environment variables** for configuration, never hardcode secrets

### Database Changes
