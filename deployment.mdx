## Railway Deployment

Railway is a cloud platform for easy deployment.

1. Sign up at [Railway](https://railway.app/).
2. Follow the [Railway Deployment Guide](https://github.com/meeran03/burki/blob/main/docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md) for step-by-step instructions.
3. Set environment variables and secrets in the Railway dashboard.
4. Deploy and monitor your app from the Railway UI.

## Manual Deployment (Linux Server)

1. Set up a Linux server (Ubuntu recommended).
2. Install Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL, and Git.
3. Clone the repo and set up the environment as in the [Installation](installation) guide.
4. Use a process manager (e.g., `systemd`, `supervisord`, or `pm2`) to keep the app running.
5. (Recommended) Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to serve the app securely over HTTPS.

## Production Tips
- Use strong, unique secrets in your `.env` file.
- Set up automated backups for your database and recordings.
- Monitor logs and metrics for performance and errors.
- Restrict API keys and credentials to only what is needed.
- Regularly update dependencies and security patches.
