## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My assistant isn't responding on calls">
    Check:
    1. Your wallet has sufficient balance
    2. The phone number is assigned to an assistant
    3. AI provider credentials are valid
    4. Check the call logs for error messages
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The response latency is high">
    Try:
    1. Use a faster LLM model (GPT-4o-mini vs GPT-4o)
    2. Use ElevenLabs or Cartesia for TTS (fastest options)
    3. Keep system prompts concise
    4. Check if provider services have any outages
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audio quality is poor">
    Burki has built-in audio denoising. If quality is still poor:
    1. Check caller's phone connection
    2. Ensure the call isn't being recorded by both parties
    3. Try a different TTS voice
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API requests return 401 Unauthorized">
    Your API key may be invalid or expired:
    1. Generate a new key in **Settings** → **API Keys**
    2. Ensure you're using `Bearer YOUR_KEY` in the Authorization header
    3. Check that the key has the required permissions
