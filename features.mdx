# Features

**Why Burki delivers what other platforms promise:** While vapi.ai struggles with 4-5 second latency and broken UIs, Burki provides a complete, production-ready platform with 0.8-1.2 second response times and interfaces that actually work.

<Warning>
**Real User Experience:** "I was a vapi.ai power user for 2.5 years. The UI never worked properly, latency was terrible (4-5 seconds), and their recent pricing changes would cost my startup $800/month. With Burki, I get sub-second response times and complete control over my costs."
