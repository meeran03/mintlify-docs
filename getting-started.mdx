## Provider Configuration

### Burki Cloud (Managed)

    Select from available options:
    - **LLM:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, xAI

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Customize model selection, voice options, and language settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Burki Cloud charges pass-through costs plus a 15% managed fee. Check the [Pricing](/pricing) page for details.

### BYO (Bring Your Own Keys)

Use your own API keys for full control over costs:

    Sign up for accounts with your preferred providers:

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select BYO Mode">
    When configuring an assistant, choose **"BYO"** and select your connected provider.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Your API keys are encrypted and stored securely. We never share them or use them for anything other than making API calls on your behalf.
</Warning>

### Hybrid Mode

## Telephony Setup

## Wallet & Billing

### Adding Funds

1. Go to **Billing** → **Wallet**

### Setting Up Auto Top-up

Never run out of credits:

3. Set your **top-up amount** (e.g., add $50)
4. Save your payment method

<Tip>
Auto top-up has a 5-minute cooldown to prevent duplicate charges during high-volume periods.
</Tip>

### Minimum Balance Requirements

| Mode | Minimum to Make Calls |
|------|----------------------|
| BYO | $0.03 |
| Burki Cloud | $2.00 |

## Environment Variables (API Users)

If you're integrating via API, you'll need:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `BURKI_API_KEY` | Your API key from the dashboard |
| `BURKI_API_URL` | `https://api.burki.dev` |

Example `.env` file:
