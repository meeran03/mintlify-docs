# Welcome to Burki Voice AI

**The Open-Source Alternative to vapi.ai That Actually Works**

**Burki** is the complete voice AI platform that delivers what proprietary solutions like vapi.ai promise but fail to provide. With ultra-low latency (0.8-1.2s vs 4-5s), transparent self-hosted pricing, and a beautiful interface that actually works, Burki is the smart choice for businesses tired of broken promises and hidden costs.

## Who is Burki for?
- Startups and enterprises looking to automate and enhance customer communication
- Developers building voice-driven applications
- Organizations needing multi-assistant, multi-organization call management

## What can Burki do?
- **Handle phone calls** using Twilio and real-time WebSocket streaming
- **Transcribe speech** instantly with Deepgram
- **Generate intelligent responses** using OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and other LLMs
- **Convert text to natural speech** with multiple TTS providers
- **Denoise and enhance audio** for crystal-clear conversations
- **Manage multiple assistants and phone numbers** from a modern web dashboard
- **Secure, multi-tenant architecture** with robust authentication and role-based access

## Why choose Burki over vapi.ai?

<Warning>
**Real User Experience:** "I was a vapi.ai power user for 2.5 years. The UI never worked properly, latency was terrible (4-5 seconds), and their recent pricing changes would cost my startup $800/month. With Burki, I get sub-second response times and complete control over my costs."
</Warning>

### 🚀 **Performance That Actually Works**
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: 0.8-1.2 seconds vs vapi.ai's 4-5+ seconds
- **Built-in Audio Denoising**: Crystal-clear calls with RNNoise
- **Production-Ready**: Multi-tenant architecture that scales

### 💰 **Transparent & Affordable**
- **No Hidden Costs**: Self-hosted means complete cost control
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Own your data and infrastructure
- **Predictable Scaling**: No surprise billing as you grow

### 🎯 **Actually Usable**
- **Beautiful Dashboard**: A web interface that works (unlike vapi.ai's broken UI)
- **All-in-One Platform**: Everything included, not scattered across services
- **Open Source**: Fully extensible and customizable for your needs
