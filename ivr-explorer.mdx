## What is IVR Explorer?

IVR Explorer automatically calls and navigates Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems to build a complete map of all menu options, then converts that map into a working AI assistant.

## How It Works

The exploration process follows five automated steps:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Provide Phone Number] --> B[System Calls IVR]
    B --> C[Navigate & Record]
    C --> D[Build Tree Map]
    D --> E[AI Summarizes]
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide Target Phone Number">
    Enter the phone number of the IVR system you want to explore in E.164 format (e.g., `+18005551234`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Calling">
    Burki calls the number and begins interacting with the IVR system automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate & Record">
    The system explores menu options by pressing keys (DTMF) or speaking, recording all prompts and responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Tree Map">
    A visual tree structure is created showing all discovered paths, menus, and terminal actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Analysis">
    Each menu option is analyzed and summarized by AI for easy understanding.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exploration Strategies

Choose the strategy that best fits your target IVR:

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **LLM-Driven** | AI decides the navigation path based on prompts | Complex IVRs with voice recognition |
| **DTMF-Only** | Systematic keypad exploration (1-9, *, #) | Simple numeric menus |
| **Hybrid** | Combines AI decisions with systematic DTMF | Most use cases (recommended) |

<Callout type="tip">
Start with the **LLM-Driven** strategy for most explorations. Switch to **DTMF-Only** if the IVR uses simple numeric menus without voice commands.
</Callout>

## Starting an Exploration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Navigate to **IVR Explorer** in your dashboard
    2. Enter the target phone number
    3. Optionally provide a friendly name (e.g., "Acme Corp Support")
    4. Select your exploration strategy
    5. Set maximum depth (how many menu levels to explore)
    6. Click **Start Exploration**
    
    The exploration typically takes 3-10 minutes depending on IVR complexity.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/ivr/explore" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "target_phone_number": "+18005551234",
        "target_name": "Acme Corp Support",
        "max_depth": 3,
        "exploration_strategy": "llm_driven",
        "language": "en"
      }'
    ```
    
    **Parameters:**
    
    | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
    |-----------|------|----------|-------------|
    | `target_phone_number` | string | Yes | Phone number in E.164 format |
    | `target_name` | string | No | Friendly name for the IVR |
    | `max_depth` | integer | No | Max menu depth to explore (1-10, default: 3) |
    | `exploration_strategy` | string | No | `llm_driven`, `dtmf_only`, or `hybrid` |
    | `language` | string | No | Expected IVR language (default: `en`) |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## IVR Tree Visualization

After exploration, you'll see an interactive tree view of the discovered IVR structure.

### Node Types

| Node Type | Icon | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Root** | Entry point of the IVR system |
| **Menu** | Options menu with multiple choices |
| **Submenu** | Nested menu within another menu |
| **Action** | Terminal action (e.g., "Your balance is...") |
| **Transfer** | Transfers to a human agent |
| **Hold** | Hold state with music or messages |
| **Loop** | Returns to a previous menu |
| **Dead End** | No further options available |

### Tree Information

Each node displays:
- **Prompt text**: What the IVR says at this point
- **AI summary**: Plain-language description of the option
- **Input to reach**: Key press or voice command needed
- **Detected options**: Available choices from this menu

<Callout type="note">
You can manually edit nodes to correct transcription errors or add notes before converting to an assistant.
</Callout>

## Converting IVR to AI Assistant

Once your IVR tree is mapped, convert it to a working AI assistant with one click.

<Accordion title="Conversion Options">
**Single Assistant (Simple IVRs)**

For IVRs with straightforward menus, Burki creates a single AI assistant that handles all paths intelligently.

**Assistant Graph (Complex IVRs)**

For IVRs with specialized departments or complex routing, Burki creates a multi-assistant graph where each major branch becomes its own specialized assistant with intelligent handoffs.

**What Gets Created:**
- System prompt based on IVR prompts and AI summaries
- Transfer scenarios matching IVR transfer points
- End call scenarios matching terminal actions
- Optional: Tool integrations for dynamic responses
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Before Converting">
1. **Review the tree**: Verify prompts are transcribed correctly
2. **Edit nodes**: Fix any errors or add clarifying notes
3. **Mark as approved**: Submit the tree for review
4. **Configure voice**: Choose TTS provider and voice for your assistant
5. **Set LLM settings**: Select the AI model to power responses
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="After Converting">
- Test your new assistant with sample calls
- Assign a phone number
- Fine-tune the system prompt if needed
- Monitor call analytics
</Accordion>

## Public Exploration (Free Tier)

Try IVR Explorer without an account:

1. Visit the IVR Explorer page
2. Enter a phone number and your email

<Callout type="warning">
Public explorations are limited to:
- 1 exploration per email address
- Maximum depth of 2 levels
- No conversion to assistant (requires signup)
</Callout>

---

## Limitations

<Accordion title="Technical Limitations">
- **Voice-only IVRs**: Speech recognition may have reduced accuracy for complex voice commands
- **Anti-bot measures**: Some IVRs detect automated systems and may behave differently
- **Long hold times**: Explorations may timeout if IVR has extended hold periods
- **International numbers**: Best results with US/Canada numbers; international coverage varies
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cost Considerations">
IVR explorations incur telephony costs:
- Each exploration makes outbound calls to the target number
- Complex IVRs with many branches require more calls
- Costs are charged to your Burki wallet at standard outbound rates
- Typical exploration: 5-15 calls depending on complexity
</Accordion>

---

## Best Practices

- **Start shallow**: Begin with `max_depth: 2` to get an overview, then increase for full mapping
- **Use descriptive names**: Name explorations clearly (e.g., "Competitor XYZ Support Line - Jan 2026")
- **Review before converting**: Always verify transcriptions and edit errors before creating assistants
- **Test thoroughly**: After conversion, test all major paths to ensure the AI handles them correctly
- **Document changes**: If the original IVR changes, re-explore and compare trees

<Callout type="success">
IVR Explorer is particularly valuable for businesses replacing legacy phone systems with AI. Map your existing IVR, convert it, and gradually improve the AI version based on real call data.
