# Phone Number Management

Burki provides comprehensive phone number management capabilities, allowing you to search, purchase, configure, and release phone numbers from both Twilio and Telnyx directly through the platform. This eliminates the need to manage numbers separately in each provider's console.

## Overview

With Burki's phone number management system, you can:

- **Search** for available numbers across multiple providers
- **Purchase** numbers instantly with automatic configuration
- **Manage** your entire phone number inventory in one place
- **Compare** costs between Twilio and Telnyx
- **Release** unused numbers to optimize costs

<Info>
**Unified Management**: Instead of juggling multiple provider dashboards, manage all your phone numbers from both Twilio and Telnyx in a single interface.

## Use Cases

### Customer Support Scaling

**Scenario**: Growing support team needs local numbers in multiple regions

```javascript
// Purchase numbers for different regions
const regions = [
  { area_code: "415", assistant_id: 101, name: "West Coast Support" },
  { area_code: "212", assistant_id: 102, name: "East Coast Support" },
  { area_code: "312", assistant_id: 103, name: "Central Support" }
];

for (const region of regions) {
  await purchaseNumber({
    area_code: region.area_code,
    provider: "telnyx",
    assistant_id: region.assistant_id,
    friendly_name: region.name
  });
}
```

### Multi-Brand Management

**Scenario**: Multiple brands need separate phone numbers

```javascript
// Different providers for different brands
await purchaseNumber({
  phone_number: "+18005551234",
  provider: "twilio",      // Premium brand uses Twilio
  assistant_id: 201,
  friendly_name: "Premium Brand Support"
});

await purchaseNumber({
  phone_number: "+18665554321", 
  provider: "telnyx",      // Budget brand uses Telnyx
  assistant_id: 202,
  friendly_name: "Budget Brand Support"
});
```

### Geographic Expansion

**Scenario**: Expanding to new international markets

```javascript
// Search for numbers in new countries
const countries = ["GB", "AU", "DE", "CA"];

for (const country of countries) {
  const numbers = await searchNumbers({
    country_code: country,
    provider: "twilio",  // Use Twilio for international
    limit: 5
  });
  
  if (numbers.length > 0) {
    await purchaseNumber({
      phone_number: numbers[0].phone_number,
      provider: "twilio",
      assistant_id: getRegionalAssistant(country)
    });
  }
}
```

### Cost Optimization Audit

**Scenario**: Regular cleanup of unused numbers

```javascript
// Monthly cleanup of unused numbers
async function monthlyAudit() {
  const numbers = await getOrganizationNumbers();
  
  for (const number of numbers) {
    const usage = await getNumberUsage(number.phone_number, 30); // Last 30 days
    
    if (usage.total_calls === 0 && usage.total_sms === 0) {
      console.log(`Releasing unused number: ${number.phone_number}`);
      await releaseNumber({ phone_number: number.phone_number });
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Cost Management

1. **Regular Audits**: Monthly review of number usage
2. **Usage Tracking**: Monitor calls and messages per number
3. **Provider Optimization**: Evaluate cost per provider
4. **Automated Cleanup**: Script to release unused numbers

### Security & Compliance

1. **Access Control**: Limit who can purchase/release numbers
2. **Audit Logging**: Track all number management activities
3. **Compliance Check**: Verify regulatory requirements by country
4. **Backup Strategy**: Document number assignments and purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Number not available" | Number taken by another user | Search for alternatives |
