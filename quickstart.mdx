## Step 2: Choose Your Setup Mode

Before creating an assistant, decide how you want to handle AI providers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Burki Cloud (Recommended)" icon="cloud">
    **Easiest to get started**
    
    - No API keys needed
    - We manage all providers
    - Pay as you go
    - Best for: Getting started quickly
  </Card>
  <Card title="BYO (Bring Your Own)" icon="key">
    **Use your existing accounts**
    
    - Connect your own API keys
    - You pay providers directly
    - Platform fees only
    - Best for: Cost optimization
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
You can start with Burki Cloud and switch to BYO later, or use a hybrid approach with some services managed and others BYO.

## Step 3: Create Your First Assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create New Assistant">
    From your dashboard, click the **"Create New Assistant"** button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Basic Info">
    - **Name:** Give your assistant a descriptive name (e.g., "Customer Support Bot")
    - **Description:** Brief description of what this assistant does
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up AI Configuration">
    Configure the three AI components:
    
    **LLM (Language Model)** - The brain
    - Choose a provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)
    - Select a model (GPT-4o recommended)
    - Write a system prompt describing your assistant's personality and purpose
    
    **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** - The voice
    - Choose a provider (ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Deepgram, etc.)
    - Select a voice that matches your brand
    
    **STT (Speech-to-Text)** - The ears
    - Deepgram Nova-3 is recommended for best accuracy
    - Choose your primary language
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign a Phone Number">
    Your trial phone number is automatically available. Assign it to your assistant to start receiving calls.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and Test">
    Click **"Create Assistant"** and call your phone number to test!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Test Your Assistant

Once your assistant is created:

1. **Call the phone number** assigned to your assistant
2. **Speak naturally** - the assistant will respond based on your configuration
3. **Check the dashboard** for call logs, transcripts, and analytics

<Tip>
Use the **Live Transcript** feature in your dashboard to monitor calls in real-time and see exactly what's being said.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Making API Calls

Once your assistant is created, you can interact with it programmatically using the API.

### Get Your API Key

1. Click on your profile in the top right corner
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Click **"Generate New API Key"**
4. Copy the key immediately (you won't see it again)

### Make Your First API Request

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/assistants/" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python Python
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/assistants/",
    headers=headers
)

print(response.json())
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://api.burki.dev/api/v1/assistants/', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Treat your API keys like passwords! Never share them publicly or commit them to version control.
</Warning>
