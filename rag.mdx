title: RAG (Knowledge Base)
---

<Callout type="info">
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) lets you give your assistant custom knowledge by uploading documents, FAQs, and other content. Your AI can then reference this information to give accurate, specific answers.
</Callout>

## What is RAG?

**RAG** combines your custom knowledge with the AI's general intelligence:

1. **Upload documents** (PDFs, text files, web pages, etc.)
2. **AI processes and indexes** the content
3. **During calls**, the AI searches your knowledge base
4. **Combines** retrieved information with its response

<Callout type="success">
Think of RAG as giving your AI a "company handbook" it can instantly reference during conversations.

</Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Configure RAG Settings">
- **Similarity Threshold:** How closely questions must match content
- **Max Results:** Number of knowledge pieces to retrieve
- **Context Window:** How much text to include in responses

## Best Practices

- **Quality over quantity:** Better to have fewer, high-quality documents than many poor ones
- **Keep content updated:** Regularly review and update your knowledge base
- **Test thoroughly:** Ask questions you expect callers to ask and verify accuracy
- **Use clear language:** Write content in plain language, avoiding jargon when possible
- **Organize logically:** Group related information together

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common RAG Issues">
- **AI doesn't find relevant info:** Check similarity threshold, add more specific keywords
- **Outdated information:** Remove or update old documents
- **Conflicting answers:** Ensure documents don't contradict each other
- **Too much irrelevant content:** Use more focused, specific documents
</Accordion>

<Callout type="tip">
RAG works best when combined with a well-written system prompt that tells the AI how to use the knowledge base effectively.
