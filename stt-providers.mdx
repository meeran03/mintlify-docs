## Key Settings

<Accordion title="Model & Language">
- **Model:** Choose based on your needs (Nova-3 recommended for English)
- **Language:** Select from common options or enter a custom language code
- **Custom Language:** Enter any Deepgram-supported language code (e.g., `fr-FR`, `es-ES`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Timing Controls">
- **Silence Threshold:** How long to wait before considering speech ended (default: 500ms)
- **Min Silence Duration:** Minimum silence before processing (default: 500ms)
- **Utterance End:** Time to wait before finalizing transcript (default: 1000ms)
- **VAD Turnoff:** Voice activity detection timeout (default: 500ms)

<Callout type="warning">
Adjust these carefully—too short and the AI cuts callers off, too long and there are awkward pauses.
</Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Processing Options">
<Checklist>
- **Punctuation:** Add punctuation to transcripts (recommended: ✅)
- **Interim Results:** Show partial transcripts as users speak (recommended: ✅)
- **Smart Format:** Format numbers, dates, etc. naturally (recommended: ✅)
- **Audio Denoising:** Remove background noise using RNNoise (optional)
</Checklist>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keywords & Keyterms">
**Keywords** (Nova-2, Nova, Enhanced, Base):
- Boost recognition of specific words
- Format: `word:boost_factor` (e.g., `Deepgram:2.0, API:1.5`)
- Great for company names, technical terms

**Keyterms** (Nova-3 only, English only):
- Advanced keyword detection
- Format: `word1, word2, word3`
- More sophisticated than keywords

<Callout type="tip">
Use keywords/keyterms for your company name, product names, and industry-specific terms to improve accuracy.
</Callout>
</Accordion>

## Audio Denoising

<Callout type="info">
Burki Voice AI includes **RNNoise** for real-time audio denoising, which removes background noise before transcription.
</Callout>

**When to Enable:**
- Noisy environments (restaurants, offices, outdoors)
- Poor phone connections
- Background music or chatter

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly increases latency (~50-100ms)
- Improves transcription accuracy in noisy conditions

---

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common STT Issues">
- **AI misses words:** Enable denoising or add keywords for important terms
- **Cuts off callers:** Increase silence threshold and utterance end timing
- **Long pauses:** Decrease timing settings, but test carefully
- **Wrong language:** Set correct language code or use "custom" option
- **Technical terms not recognized:** Add them as keywords/keyterms
</Accordion>

---

## Best Practices

- **Start with defaults** and adjust based on testing
- **Test with real calls** in your target environment
- **Use keywords** for your business-specific terminology
- **Enable denoising** if you expect background noise
- **Monitor call quality** and adjust timing as needed
