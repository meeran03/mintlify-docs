## Key Settings

<Accordion title="Model & Language">
- **Provider:** Choose Deepgram for speed or Azure for enterprise features
- **Model:** Choose based on your needs (Nova-3 for English, Standard for multi-language)
- **Language:** Select from common options or enter a custom language code
- **Custom Language:** Enter any supported language code (e.g., `fr-FR`, `es-ES`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Timing Controls">
These settings control how the STT provider detects when someone has finished speaking. Getting these right is crucial for natural conversation flow.

### Endpointing (Silence Threshold)
**What it does**: How long the provider waits after detecting silence before considering speech has ended.

**Technical Details**:
- **Measured in**: Milliseconds
- **Default**: 10ms (minimal endpointing for real-time applications)
- **Range**: 10ms - 2000ms (recommended)
- **Config Path**: `stt_settings.endpointing.silence_threshold`

**Real Example**:
- 10ms: Very responsive (default) - might cut off slow speakers
- 500ms: "I need help with..." → 0.5s silence → Provider says "speech ended"
- 1000ms: More patient (good for people who pause while thinking)

**When to Adjust**:
- **Lower (10-100ms)**: For fast talkers or quick interactions (default)
- **Higher (500-1000ms)**: For elderly callers or complex topics
- **Much higher (1500ms+)**: For people with speech difficulties

### Min Silence Duration  
**What it does**: Internal timeout for utterance processing when the provider doesn't send `speech_final` (not sent to provider API).

**Technical Details**:
- **Measured in**: Milliseconds
- **Default**: 1500ms
- **Range**: 500ms - 5000ms (recommended)
- **Config Path**: `stt_settings.endpointing.min_silence_duration`
- **Used for**: Call handler utterance timeout logic when `speech_final` is missing

**Real Example**:
- 1500ms: Wait 1.5s for `speech_final`, then process accumulated utterance (default)
- 1000ms: Quicker timeout for responsive conversation
- 2500ms: More patience for complex responses or noisy environments

**When to Adjust**:
- **Lower (500-1000ms)**: For quick, responsive interactions
- **Higher (2000-3000ms)**: For environments with background noise where `speech_final` may be unreliable
- **Match with conversation style**: Shorter for rapid-fire Q&A, longer for detailed discussions

### Utterance End Timeout
**What it does**: Maximum time the provider waits for a complete utterance before sending UtteranceEnd event.

**Technical Details**:
- **Measured in**: Milliseconds  
- **Default**: 1000ms
- **Range**: 500ms - 5000ms (recommended)
- **Config Path**: `stt_settings.utterance_end_ms`
- **API Parameter**: `utterance_end_ms`

**Real Example**:
- 1000ms: If someone starts talking but doesn't finish within 1 second, provider sends UtteranceEnd (default)
- 500ms: Quick timeout (might cut off long sentences)
- 2000ms: Patient timeout (good for complex responses)

**When to Adjust**:
- **Lower (500-800ms)**: For short, quick interactions
- **Higher (1500-3000ms)**: For detailed conversations or forms
- **Consider your use case**: Customer service vs. quick orders

### VAD Events
**What it does**: Enables Voice Activity Detection events for enhanced speech detection and UtteranceEnd events.

**Technical Details**:
- **Type**: Boolean (true/false)
- **Default**: true (enabled)
- **Config Path**: `stt_settings.vad_events`
- **API Parameter**: `vad_events`

**Real Example**:
- true: Enhanced speech detection with UtteranceEnd events when `speech_final` doesn't work (recommended)
- false: Basic speech detection only (legacy mode)

**When to Enable**:
- **Always recommended**: Provides better speech detection in noisy environments
- **Essential for**: Background noise, poor connections, multiple speakers
- **Backup mechanism**: When `speech_final` doesn't trigger due to audio issues

**Why It Matters**: VAD events provide UtteranceEnd signals as a fallback when normal speech detection fails due to background noise or audio quality issues.

<Card title="🎯 Timing Settings Quick Guide" icon="target">
  **Real-Time/Fast Conversations (Default)**: 
  - Endpointing: 10ms, Min Silence: 1500ms, Utterance End: 1000ms, VAD Events: true
  
  **Balanced Professional**: 
  - Endpointing: 300ms, Min Silence: 1500ms, Utterance End: 1500ms, VAD Events: true
  
  **Patient/Elderly Callers**: 
  - Endpointing: 800ms, Min Silence: 2500ms, Utterance End: 2000ms, VAD Events: true
</Card>

<Callout type="warning">
**Critical**: These settings work together with [Call Management interruption settings](/call-management). **Endpointing** controls provider responsiveness, **Min Silence Duration** controls internal timeout handling, and both affect conversation flow timing.
</Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Processing Options">
<Checklist>
- **Punctuation:** Add punctuation to transcripts (recommended: ✅)
- **Interim Results:** Show partial transcripts as users speak (recommended: ✅)
- **Smart Format:** Format numbers, dates, etc. naturally (recommended: ✅)
- **Audio Denoising:** Remove background noise using RNNoise (optional)
</Checklist>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keywords & Keyterms">
**Keywords** (Deepgram Nova-2, Nova, Enhanced, Base):
- Boost recognition of specific words
- Format: `word:boost_factor` (e.g., `Deepgram:2.0, API:1.5`)
- Great for company names, technical terms

**Keyterms** (Deepgram Nova-3 only, English only):
- Advanced keyword detection
- Format: `word1, word2, word3`
- More sophisticated than keywords

**Phrase Lists** (Azure Speech):
- Boost recognition of specific terms
- Format: Comma-separated list
- Works with all Azure models and languages

<Callout type="tip">
Use keywords/keyterms/phrase lists for your company name, product names, and industry-specific terms to improve accuracy.

## Audio Denoising

<Callout type="info">
Burki Voice AI includes **RNNoise** for real-time audio denoising, which removes background noise before transcription.
</Callout>

**When to Enable:**
- Noisy environments (restaurants, offices, outdoors)
- Poor phone connections
- Background music or chatter

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly increases latency (~50-100ms)
- Improves transcription accuracy in noisy conditions

---

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common STT Issues & Solutions">
**Speech Detection Problems:**
- **AI misses words:** Enable denoising or add keywords/phrase lists for important terms
- **Cuts off callers mid-sentence:** Increase endpointing (10ms → 500ms) and utterance end timeout
- **Long awkward pauses:** Decrease min silence duration for faster internal processing
- **Interrupts slow speakers:** Increase endpointing and min silence duration  
- **Misses trailing words:** Enable VAD events and increase utterance end timeout

**Language & Recognition:**
- **Wrong language detected:** Set correct language code or use "custom" option
- **Technical terms not recognized:** Add them as keywords/keyterms/phrase lists with boost factors
- **Company names garbled:** Add company/product names to keywords list

**Audio Quality:**
- **Noisy background:** Enable audio denoising and increase VAD turnoff
- **Poor phone connection:** Enable denoising and use more conservative timing settings
- **Multiple speakers:** Use higher silence thresholds to avoid cross-talk issues

**Provider-Specific:**
- **Deepgram connection issues:** Verify your Deepgram API key in **Settings** → **Provider Keys**
- **Azure authentication failed:** Verify subscription key and region match your Speech resource in **Settings** → **Provider Keys**

<Callout type="tip">
**Testing Strategy**: Record test calls with different timing settings and listen to the conversation flow. What feels natural to you will feel natural to callers.
</Callout>
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

- **Start with defaults** and adjust based on testing
- **Test with real calls** in your target environment
- **Use term boosting** (keywords/keyterms/phrase lists) for your business-specific terminology
- **Enable denoising** if you expect background noise
- **Monitor call quality** and adjust timing as needed
- **Choose the right provider** based on your primary needs (speed vs. language support)

## How STT Works with Call Management

<Card title="🔗 STT + Call Management = Natural Conversations" icon="link">
  **STT Settings** control when the provider detects speech has ended.
  
  **Call Management Settings** control how your AI responds to that detected speech.
  
  Both must work together for natural conversation flow!
</Card>

**The Flow**:
1. **STT detects speech** using your timing settings (silence threshold, VAD, etc.)
2. **Call Management decides response** using interruption and timeout settings  
3. **Result**: Natural conversation or awkward pauses

**Key Relationships**:
- STT `min_silence_duration` (internal timeout) should be longer than Call Management `interruption_cooldown`
- Lower STT `endpointing` (more responsive) works well with lower Call Management `interruption_threshold`
- Higher STT timing settings pair well with patient Call Management `idle_timeout`

<Callout type="info">
**Next Step**: Configure [Call Management settings](/call-management) to control conversation flow after STT detects speech.
