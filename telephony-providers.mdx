## Per-Assistant Configuration

Each assistant can use different telephony credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit Assistant">
    Go to your assistant's settings page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Telephony">
    In the **Telephony** section, you can:
    - Use organization defaults (recommended)
    - Override with assistant-specific credentials
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign Numbers">
    Assign phone numbers that use the appropriate provider credentials.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Best Practice:** Use organization-level credentials as defaults, and only override at the assistant level when you have specific requirements (e.g., different regions, different billing accounts).
</Tip>

## Mixed Provider Setup

You can use different providers for different use cases:

| Use Case | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| **US/Canada focus** | Any provider works well |
| **EU data residency** | Vonage with Europe region |
| **APAC compliance** | Vonage with Asia Pacific region |
| **Cost optimization** | Compare pricing for your call volumes |
| **Existing relationship** | Use your current provider with BYO |
