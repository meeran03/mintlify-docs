## Common Tuning Mistakes

<Card title="⚠️ Avoid These Pitfalls" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  Learn from common voice tuning mistakes to save time and improve results.
</Card>

<Accordion title="Over-Optimization">
**Problem**: Adjusting too many parameters at once

**Solution**:
- Change one parameter at a time
- Test each change thoroughly
- Keep notes on what works
- Use A/B testing for comparisons

**Example**: Don't change stability, similarity, and style simultaneously
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extreme Settings">
**Problem**: Using values at the far ends of ranges (0.0 or 1.0)

**Solution**:
- Start with recommended ranges
- Use extreme values only for specific effects
- Test thoroughly before production use
- Consider user experience impact

**Example**: `style: 1.0` often sounds unnatural for business use
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ignoring Use Case">
**Problem**: Using the same settings for different applications

**Solution**:
- Create setting profiles for different use cases
- Consider your audience and context
- Test with actual content types
- Adjust based on user feedback

**Example**: Phone call settings ≠ podcast settings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Neglecting Voice Selection">
**Problem**: Focusing only on parameters, ignoring voice choice

**Solution**:
- Voice selection is often more important than fine-tuning
- Test multiple voices with your content
- Consider voice personality match
- Use provider recommendations

**Example**: Wrong voice + perfect settings < Right voice + default settings
</Accordion>
