# Usage

This page explains how to use Burki Voice AI as an end user, admin, or developer.

## Web Dashboard

The web dashboard at [burki.dev/dashboard](https://burki.dev/dashboard) is the main interface for managing your voice AI system.

### Common Tasks

- **Log in** with your credentials or Google account
- **Create or edit assistants**: Set up personalities, assign phone numbers, and configure integrations
- **View call history**: Access transcripts, recordings, and analytics
- **Manage billing**: Add funds, view usage, and configure auto top-up
- **Manage team**: Add team members, set roles, and manage permissions

## Phone Call Flow

Burki handles real phone calls through your configured telephony provider.

### Inbound Call Flow

1. **Customer calls your number** assigned to an assistant
2. **Burki answers** and plays the greeting message
3. **Real-time transcription** converts speech to text
4. **AI generates response** based on the conversation context
5. **Text-to-speech** converts the response to natural speech
6. **Customer hears response** with sub-second latency
7. **Call is recorded** and available in the dashboard

### Outbound Call Flow

1. **API request** triggers an outbound call
2. **Burki dials** the target number
3. **Same conversation flow** once connected
4. **Webhook notification** sent with call status
