## Getting Started

### Step 1: Upload Voice Sample

Navigate to your assistant's configuration and open the Voice Cloning section:

1. **Upload Audio File**: Drag and drop or click to select your audio file
2. **Add Metadata**: Provide a name, description, and tags
3. **Validation**: System automatically validates audio quality
4. **Processing**: File is uploaded and prepared for cloning

```javascript Example Upload
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', audioFile);
formData.append('name', 'Professional Voice');
formData.append('description', 'Clear, professional speaking voice');
formData.append('tags', 'professional, clear, business');

const response = await fetch('/assistants/123/voice-samples/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});
```

### Step 2: Create Cloned Voice

Once your sample is uploaded, create a cloned voice:

1. **Select Provider**: Choose ElevenLabs or Resemble AI
2. **Configure Options**: Set voice name, language, and quality settings
3. **Initiate Cloning**: Start the voice training process
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track cloning status in real-time

```javascript Example Voice Creation
const response = await fetch('/assistants/123/cloned-voices/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    voice_sample_id: 456,
    provider: 'elevenlabs',
    name: 'Custom Professional Voice',
    language: 'en',
    enhance_quality: true
  })
});
```

### Step 3: Use Cloned Voice

Once processing is complete, assign the voice to your assistant:

1. **Voice Selection**: Choose from your cloned voices
2. **Testing**: Preview the voice with sample text
3. **Assignment**: Set as the assistant's default voice
4. **Go Live**: Start using the voice in live calls
